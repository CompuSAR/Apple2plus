# Apple2plus
Apple 2 plus compatible implementation on an FPGA

## Installation Instructions
You will need to install Xilinx's Vivado suite. The free version works just fine for that purpose.

Clone this repository, and make sure to run `git submodules update --install` to get the 6502 and UART cores as well.

You can now point Vivado to the repository's xpr file.
